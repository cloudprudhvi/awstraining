# AWS EC2

## Introduction
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), a flexible IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) that allows users to run virtual servers in the cloud. Just like selecting a new laptop based on its specifications, EC2 enables the configuration of virtual servers with similar criteria.

## Selecting Specifications for EC2

### AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
#### Overview
- **Definition**: AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. It's essentially a snapshot of a configured server that includes the operating system, installed software, and configuration settings.
- **Customization**: AMIs allow you to customize your instance with specific software, configurations, monitoring tools, etc., essentially packaging everything needed for the instance to run according to your specifications.
- **Efficiency**: Using an AMI can lead to faster boot and configuration times because all the necessary software is pre-packaged into the image.
- **Region Specific**: AMIs are built for specific AWS regions but can be copied across regions to facilitate global deployments.
- **Sources**:
  - **Public AMI**: Provided by AWS, these are generally available and commonly used for a wide range of applications.
  - **Your own AMI**: You can create and maintain custom AMIs for your specific needs.
  - **AWS Marketplace AMI**: These AMIs are created and potentially sold by third-party vendors through the AWS Marketplace.

#### AMI Process
- **Start an EC2 instance**: Launch and configure it with your applications and settings.
- **Stop the instance**: It's important to stop the instance to ensure data integrity before creating an AMI.
- **Build an AMI**: This process creates an image of your instance and includes creating EBS (Elastic Block Store) snapshots of any attached volumes.
- **Launch instances**: Once your AMI is created, you can launch new instances from this AMI, which will be exact replicas of the original instance configuration.

### Instance Type
- **Overview**: This refers to the mix of CPU (processor power) and RAM (memory) that defines the capacity of your EC2 instance.
- **Details**: Instance types are grouped into families, each optimized for particular uses, similar to how laptops are specialized for gaming, professional software, or general use.

## EC2 Instance Families

| Instance Family | Description | Common Use Cases |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| T Family (General Purpose) | Balanced CPU and memory, cost-effective | Web servers, small and medium databases, development environments |
| M Family (General Purpose) | Higher compute, memory, and network resources than T Family | Application servers, caching fleets, backend servers for enterprise applications |
| C Family (Compute Optimized) | High CPU power relative to memory | High-performance computing, scientific modeling, batch processing |
| R Family (Memory Optimized) | Optimized for memory-intensive applications | Large databases, data mining, in-memory databases like SAP HANA |
| G Family (Accelerated Computing) | GPUs for graphic-intensive applications | Machine learning, video encoding, 3D rendering applications |
| I Family (Storage Optimized) | High-speed storage, optimized for I/O intensive operations | High-performance databases, NoSQL databases, data warehousing |

### AMI ID Importance
- **Consistency**: Choosing an AMI with a specific AMI ID ensures that every instance launched will have the same configuration. This promotes consistency and reliability across your cloud infrastructure, similar to using the same software setup across multiple computers.
