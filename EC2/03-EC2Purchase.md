# EC2 Instance Purchase Options

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides several purchase options for using computing resources, each designed to optimize costs and manageability based on different use cases.

## 1. On-Demand Instances
### Overview
On-Demand Instances are the default choice when launching an instance without any specific commitments or upfront payment. You pay for compute capacity by the hour or by the second, depending on the instance you choose. The cost is higher compared to other options, but you get a 100% uptime guarantee and no long-term commitment, providing maximum flexibility.
### Use Cases
This option is ideal for applications that require immediate, reliable access to computing resources without any interruption, such as web servers, development and test environments, and any other application that may have unpredictable workloads. On-Demand Instances are also perfect for startups and other businesses experimenting with new projects to determine their needs before committing to a longer-term, more cost-effective purchasing option.

## 2. Spot Instances
### Overview
Spot Instances allow you to take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud at up to 90% off the regular price. While they provide significant savings, they do so with the caveat that these instances can be reclaimed by AWS with just a two-minute notification, should the demand for capacity rise.
### Use Cases
Spot Instances are best suited for workloads that can be flexible in terms of timing and do not require persistent compute capacity. They are ideal for various stateless, fault-tolerant applications such as big data analytics jobs, large scale parallel processing workloads, and background processing tasks that can be interrupted without any business impact.

## 3. Reserved Instances
### Overview
Reserved Instances offer you the ability to reserve a specific instance configuration on a one or three-year commitment basis, which can lead to a discount of up to 75% compared to On-Demand pricing. You pay upfront, partially upfront, or no upfront based on your cash flow and budget.
### Use Cases
Reserved Instances are well-suited for steady-state, predictable workloads that require assured availability. Common scenarios include enterprise applications, database servers, and other applications that need a consistent and secure compute capacity. They are also beneficial for businesses with a known minimum usage requirement that seek cost predictability.

## 4. Savings Plans
### Overview
Savings Plans provide flexible pricing models that offer low-cost usage rates in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) over a 1 or 3-year period. Savings of up to 72% can be achieved, similar to Reserved Instances, but with added flexibility to change instance families, operating systems, and regions.
### Use Cases
This option is advantageous for users with a broad set of use cases across EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda. Itâ€™s particularly appealing for dynamic environments where usage might vary but consistently reaches a certain level of expenditure. Savings Plans are great for companies that require the flexibility to explore different configurations and services while still benefiting from substantial savings.
